### Disclaimer

Running eBPF programs generally requires root access or the **CAP_BPF** capability. The kernel verifier guards against crashes, but inefficient or incorrectly attached programs can still degrade performance or disrupt networking. Test all examples on a non-production system first. Neither the author shall be liable for any damages arising from the use of this material.

Running eBPF programs requires elevated privileges and can affect system stability. Follow the examples at your own risk. Neither the author nor the publisher shall be liable for any damages arising from the use of this material.
