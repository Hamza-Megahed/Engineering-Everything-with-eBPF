### Netflix: Performance Tracing and Debugging

Netflix relies heavily on maintaining a high level of performance and reliability for its massive streaming infrastructure. With millions of users accessing content simultaneously, identifying performance bottlenecks and ensuring smooth streaming is critical. To address these challenges, Netflix leverages eBPF for advanced performance tracing and debugging.

eBPF allows Netflix engineers to dynamically instrument production systems to gain real-time insights into various kernel and application-level events without impacting system performance. Tools like BPFtrace and bcc (BPF Compiler Collection) help trace everything from CPU utilization to memory allocation and disk I/O latency. eBPF enables the monitoring of these metrics without requiring code modifications or system restarts, providing a seamless debugging experience.

One of the key benefits for Netflix is the ability to analyze issues in real time. When a problem arises, engineers can deploy eBPF-based tracing programs to identify the root cause immediately. This minimizes downtime and ensures rapid resolution. For example, if a particular server experiences unexpected delays, eBPF can quickly pinpoint whether the issue stems from the network stack, disk latency, or a CPU bottleneck.

Moreover, eBPF’s low overhead makes it suitable for use in high-traffic production environments. Unlike traditional tracing tools, which often introduce performance degradation, eBPF maintains efficiency while providing deep insights. This combination of power and performance helps Netflix maintain the quality of service users expect.


### Facebook (Meta): Load Balancing with Katran

Facebook (now Meta) handles billions of user interactions daily, requiring robust and efficient load-balancing mechanisms. To achieve this, Facebook developed Katran, a high-performance, eBPF-based layer 4 load balancer. Katran powers the edge network for Facebook’s backend services, providing scalable and reliable traffic distribution.

Katran uses XDP eBPF to offload load-balancing tasks to the Linux kernel, bypassing some of the traditional limitations of user-space load balancers. By running directly in the kernel, eBPF ensures that packet processing is both fast and efficient, reducing the need for context switches and avoiding bottlenecks.

A key feature of Katran is its ability to dynamically adapt to changes in traffic patterns. eBPF programs enable the load balancer to update its forwarding rules on the fly without requiring restarts. This dynamic updating capability ensures minimal disruption and allows Facebook to handle sudden traffic surges smoothly https://engineering.fb.com/2018/05/22/open-source/open-sourcing-katran-a-scalable-network-load-balancer/.


### Cloudflare: DDoS Mitigation

Cloudflare provides security and performance services to millions of websites worldwide, making it a prime target for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. To protect against these attacks, Cloudflare uses XDP eBPF to enhance its DDoS mitigation capabilities.

eBPF enables Cloudflare to monitor network traffic in real time, identifying and filtering out malicious packets before they reach the application layer. By deploying eBPF programs directly in the kernel, Cloudflare can analyze packet headers, track connection states, and enforce filtering rules with minimal latency.

One advantage of using eBPF for DDoS mitigation is its flexibility. eBPF allows Cloudflare to update filtering logic dynamically, adapting to new attack vectors without requiring system downtime or restarts. For example, when a new type of DDoS attack is identified, Cloudflare can deploy an updated eBPF filter to block the attack within seconds https://blog.cloudflare.com/l4drop-xdp-ebpf-based-ddos-mitigations/.

Moreover, eBPF’s performance efficiency ensures that mitigation measures do not degrade legitimate traffic. Cloudflare can maintain high throughput and low latency even when under attack, providing a seamless experience for end users.
